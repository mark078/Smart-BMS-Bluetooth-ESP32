/**
Program to read out and display 
data from xiaoxiang Smart BMS 
over Bluetooth Low Energy
https://www.lithiumbatterypcb.com/
Tested with original BLE module provided.
Might work with generic BLE module when UUIDs are modified

Needs ESP32 and graphic display.
Tested on TTGO TS https://github.com/LilyGO/TTGO-TS

thanks to Petr Jenik for big parts of code
thanks to Milan Petrzilka

known bugs:
-if BLE server is not available during startup, program hangs
-reconnection sort of works, sometimes ESP reboots
